## Preparation:

Update your machine BIOS to latest version
and turn off Secure Boot in BIOS !

#### What you will need:
- USB thumb drives (One for clover one for macOS installer is in my opinion better)

- Knowledge of booting the macOS installer using Clover

#### Following configs and kexts are needed to boot and use the installer:

nVME Patch (RehabMan/patch-nvme) (RehabMan, Pike R. Alpha, Mork vom Ork)
- Otherwise internal SSD will NOT be detected by installer

HD620 clover config file (RehabMan)
- Otherwise installer wont even boot

USBInjectAll.kext (RehabMan)
- Nice to have that one USB port working

VoodooPS2Controller.kext (RehabMan)
- Otherwise no keyboard or touchpad for u

FakeSMC.kext (netkas, RehabMan)
- duh...
